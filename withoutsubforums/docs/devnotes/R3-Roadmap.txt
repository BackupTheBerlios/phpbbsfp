Minerva R3 Roadmap - Living Document v1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last Update : 10th August 2004

This is document is dynamic, and serves as a Roadmap through the mile stones and work list.
If you find yourself at a loose end, pick a job from the list below, check that no
one else is working on it already and post a message in the forums stating that you are
working on it.

Everything here is up for discussion, thoughts, comments and suggestions are welcome.

Milestone 1
~~~~~~~~~~~

Goal : If you see the oppotunity to improve the performance or efficiency, do it!

Source Headers
 - As you edit or created new .php files replace all the source headers with the new header
   format, ** but make sure you retain any valid copyrights! **

ACM
 - The following tables are the priority for caching in M1
    * $table_prefix.'acronyms'
    * $table_prefix.'smart'
    * $table_prefix.'config'
    * $table_prefix.'flags'
    * $table_prefix.'modules'
    * $table_prefix.'ranks'
    * $table_prefix.'referers'
    * $table_prefix.'rules'
    * $table_prefix.'smilies'
    * $table_prefix.'themes'
    * $table_prefix.'themes_name'
    * $table_prefix.'words'
    * $table_prefix.'blocks'
    * $table_prefix.'block_position'
    * $table_prefix.'block_layout'
    * $table_prefix.'block_config'
    * $table_prefix.'block_variable'
    * $table_prefix.'menu_links'
    * $table_prefix.'user_menu_links'
    * $table_prefix.'user_portal_links'

XHTML Comliance
 - If you are adding or updating a .tpl help Dave out by checking for common
   XHTML errors, such as...

     * <br /> instead of <br>
     * <input xxxx /> instead of <input xxxx>
     * <img src=xxxx /> instead of <img src=xxxx>
     * Example XHTML compliant JavaScript

     <script language="Javascript" type="text/javascript">
     //<![CDATA[
     if ( {PRIVATE_MESSAGE_NEW_FLAG} )
     {
        window.open('{U_PRIVATEMSGS_POPUP}', '_minervaprivmsg', 'HEIGHT=225,resizable=yes,WIDTH=400');;
     }
     //]]>
     </script>

Module Engine
 - Module interoperability functions
     * Extend the modules API with some functions to query the status of other modules.
       This is useful if we want to write a module or block which can draw data from several
       other modules based on their status, version, etc...

       GetmvInstalled($status);                 returns a list of installed modules of the given status
       GetmvModuleStatus($modulename);          returns the status of the given module
       GetmvModuleVersion($modulename);         returns the version of the given module
       IsmvModuleDefault($modulename);          returns true if the given module is default
       GetmvModuleRootPath($modulename);        returns the module root path of the given module, in the forum 'index.php?module=name'
       GetmvFilePath($modulename, $filename);   returns a correctly formatted path to the given file for the given module.
       GetmvDependacy($modulename);             returns the given modules version number if is it currently installed and active.

PCP 2.1.1 Upgrade
 - This upgrade is most desirable because it fixes various bugs, including the following issues...
    * http://rpgnet.clanmckeen.com/demo/viewtopic.php?t=1714

   The Memberlist doesn't work for non Admins after fresh install and a number of settings are not correctly
   initialised after a fresh install. The work around is to configure everything in the Configuration+ ACP to Yes
   and then go back and setup the options how your really want them.

   This upgrade needs to be carefully merged in so as not to break the Advanced PM system, add any of Ptirhiiks cache
   back in or break any additions we have already made the the PCP. The APM is known to not work with PCP 2.1.1 by default,
   but I have seen reports that it can be made to work...

    * http://rpgnet.clanmckeen.com/demo/viewtopic.php?p=14393#14393

   Although I have not assigned anyone to this task I would really like club60.org to take it on, because I have some ideas
   for M2 which integrate the PCP and module engine therefore it would be valuable if he has an intimate understanding of how
   the PCP hangs together.

Block Engine
 - Stop duplicate layout names being created in the ACP.
 - Any block specific configuration options should be configurable
   via that blocks edit screen in the ACP, not from the general
   Block Configuration ACP screen.

CustomBBCode
 - Dave to integrate new bbCode parser and CustomBBCode
 - We can bump this to M2 if need be as we have a functional bbcode parser currently.

Rules
 - Currently Supports
    * Site Rules
    * Forum Rules
    * Terms of Use
    * Privacy Policy
    * Copyright Notice
 - Remove the Configuration+ option for enabling rules, they are now only displayed if they have content.
 - Relocate where the forum rules are displayed. Displaying them at the top of the forum is a bit intrusive.
   Maybe include them with the list of forum capabilities, something like...
     'You *should* read our rules in this forum' at the top of the list.
 - When registering the Site Rules should be displayed if they exist and links to the Terms and Privacy policy should
   be displayed if they are populated too.

Advanced PM
 - Legacy PM code needs converting, just the Attachment mod to go.
 - Integrate Attachment support, need doing because some of the Attachment ACP is broken.

Prillian
 - Integrate cross browser compatible Javascript (posting.js)

PayPal Group Subscriptions
 - Make it DBAL compliant and the ACP does not work correctly.
 - There is a problem when viewing your groups, sometimes it displays "No Groups Exist"
 - If you get this error add a normal non-subscription based group. When there is at least
   one normal non-subscription based (open or closed) group you will not see this error
   message. If you have only subscription based and hidden groups you will see this error.

Advanced Post Count
 - club60.org has integrated his advanced post count mod and will enhance it futher by adding Post Count
   Resyncing to it and removing the seperate Post Count Resync ACP.

FAQ
 - Migrate the FAQ to 'Online Minerva Help' for users.
 - Mostly a simple name change, so that a 'proper' FAQ module could be written.

Group Priorities
 - We need a new field adding to the 'phpbb_groups' called 'group_priority'.
 - We also need a new ACP for managing the Group priority.
 - The reason for adding these new features will become apparent in the future, but the
   basic reason is so when we have Ranks for Groups and Colour Groups re-integrated in the core,
   a users group colour and/or group rank will be derived from the group they belong to with the
   highest priority.

Spell Checker
 - The OpenSpell(); JavaScript function needs updating so that the spell checker can be used within
   modules.

Word Censors
- More powerful word censor

Milestone 2
~~~~~~~~~~~

More Performance Tweaks
 - http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=135383
 - How much can we use from the examples posted in this topic?

Attachments
 - Anti Leech options in 'download.php' should be ACP configurable.
 - Maybe even added to board_config, so the same code in Photo Album could use a site wide config?

Post Icons
 - Use DB for configuration settings, not the current Ptirhiik config file.

Wider Group Usage
 - Pay Cash (virtual cash) to join a group. Make this part of PayPal Groups Subscriptions so admins can select if a group is a paypal or cash subscription.
 - Custom Title capabilities should optionally be based on a Group membership.
 - Avatar capabilities should optionally be based on Group membership.
 - What else could be group membership retricted?
    * The reason for making more features group membership restricted is so admins can make better use of cash for controlling
      who has what capabilities, therefore giving cash some 'real' value. I also want to get away from capabilities being controlled by post count and
      length of membership. Length of membership is still valid, but post count is not it promotes spamming to gain permissions.
    * If an admin wants to run some kind of 'pay' site they can use PayPal Group Subscriptions to get revenue for certain capabilities and features.
 - Add the Group Ranks mod    [ Group Priorities in M1 need to be completed first and integrated into this mod ]
 - Add the Colour Groups mod  [ Group Priorities in M1 need to be completed first and integrated into this mod ]
    * http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=216790

Admin Tools
 - There are a number of mods which need adding to imporve the tools available to admins to manage their site.
 - I will add details of required features here when M2 is underway.
    * Potect User Accounts

Yellow Card
 - Tune/enhance the Yellow Card mod.

Modules and Blocks
 - Dave has already done some work on module uploading
     * More details to come from Dave nearer completion
     * Blocks should be uploadable too.
 - Integrate the modules into the Online Help system, dependant on M1 task completion.

Unix Sendmail Support
 - Add Unix sendmail support to the emailer class for improved e-mail delivery on system with sendmail available.

Configuration ACP Consolidation [ ** DO NOT START WITHOUT GETTING AGREEMENT FROM MARTIN ** ]
 - Move the remaining Configuration Items from Configuration to Configuration+

Menu Manager                    [ ** DO NOT START WITHOUT GETTING AGREEMENT FROM MARTIN ** ]
 - Move the Administrative configuration features to the ACP
 - Move the User configuration options to the PCP

Functionise User Deletion
 - User deletions currently take place in several locations and the code is almost identical in each...
    * admin/admin_users.php
    * admin/admin_users_inactive.php
    * includes/mods_settings/mod_profile_control_panel.php
 - A single function, delete_user(); would be useful.

Sessions and Online SearchBots
 - Back port phpBB 2.1.x code?
 - Martin has added UserAgent and SearchBot capabilities to the existing sessions code.

Content Abstraction Layer
 - R3 should be able to server content in any of the following formats...
    * XHTML for Browsers
    * PDA (simple HTML) for PDAs
    * WML for Cell phones
    * XML for RSS readers

 - To do this I propose we add a hidden HTTP post variable 'content'. When 'content=xhtml' or is not
   defined then the current 'normal' template is used, when 'content=xml' the the 'templates/xml' template
   is used so long as it exists, and so on for WML and PDA...

 - I think this approach would make it easy to design templates for publishing content in any number of formats.
   Clearly this is just a rough idea, but we can discuss the concept in the forums.


Upgrade/Migration Script(s)
 - What upgrade paths will we support?

Removing phpBB                  [ ** DO NOT START WITHOUT GETTING AGREEMENT FROM MARTIN ** ]
 - Seek out the remaining phpBB references (not copyrights!) and remove them.
     * A good deal of this is already done.
     * This includes defines and DB prefixes.

Mod Author Approvals
 - Every MOD integrated into R3 should have approval from the original author,
   or we have tried our best to get that approval.

Multiple Choice Voting
 - http://www.vilaras.gr/multivote_mod/
 - Update Poll Block and Poll Overview Module

JavaScript rationalisation
 - Move the Javascript ou of the templates into temaplates/subSilver/js/file.js
 - Include 're-usable' JavaScript code rather than having the same stuff
   repeated in multiple templates.

Referers Replacement
- Remove existing referers mod.
- Replace with http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=188175

Milestone 3
~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new default style/template for R3.
 - Probably dervied from subSilver to some extent.
 - CSS use needs rationalising
 - All the images need replacing with our own that we can
   release under the GPL. Everaldo already approved the use
   of the Crystal icons should we need them.
     * http://www.everaldo.com
 - R3 GDK
 - R3 SDK
    * Move the PCP and Extended Lang ACP stuff to a module.

Documentation
 - Administrator Guides
    * Installion, configuration and management of R3.
 - Developer Guides
    * Minerva Certified Module Program
    * Minerva Certified Block Program
    * Module and Block which are certified by the Project Minerva Team meet certain
      coding practices. We need to define what these criteria are and create a
      certification request form outlining them all.

The future?
~~~~~~~~~~~

I am quite happy to move these things into M1, M2 or M3, but I need more feedback
and ideas for the rest of the development team to better understand what needs
to be done exactly. On receipt of additional information I can reschedule them.

APIs
 - Topic/Post Insertion
     * insert_post() to be added to includes/functions_messages.php
       remove duplicate function from KB, News and Weblinks modules.

 - PM Insertion                  (see includes/functions_messages.php)
     * send_pm()

 - Cash                          (see includes/functions_cash.php)

 - Modules                       (see includes/modules.php)

 - Blocks

File Structure.
 - Rationalise the core file layout.

Object Orientatation

Ptirhiik Variable Maps
 - Can we migrate the contents of 'profilcp/def/' to the DB and cache them via the ACM?
     * def_userfields.php
     * def_userfields_phpbb.php
     * def_userfuncs.php
     * def_userfuncs_custom.php
     * def_userfuncs_std.php
     * def_userfuncs_vlist.php
     * def_usermaps.php

Junior Admin
 - Keep Nivisec code (and extended it) or back port the 2.1x Junior Admin?
 - Martin would prefer to extend the Jnr. Admin code.

Text Editor
 - Could we replace the standard post/text editor with something better?
 - What about an optional WYSIWYG editor?
    * http://www.kevinroth.com/rte/demo.htm

DBMS Compatibility
 - I would love for R3 to support all the DBMS platforms that phpBB 2.1/2.2 does.
 - We probably need some new developers (DBAs) to help with this?

Unified Searching
 - Anything which has a search capability, forums, modules, member list, etc,
   should be searchable via a single search screen.

The Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~

Goal :  All modules which use comments should use the same forum based system
        as utilised in the KB module.
