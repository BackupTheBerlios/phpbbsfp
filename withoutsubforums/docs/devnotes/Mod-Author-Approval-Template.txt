DRAFT - 3

Hello,

My name is Martin and I am the lead developer and project coordinator
for Minerva, a *real* portal solution derived from phpBB2 and licensed
under the GPL. You can find out more about Minerva from...

http://www.flexion.org
http://minerva.sourceforge.net
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/minerva/
http://www.project-minerva.org

We are seeking approval to include your...

* [ enter mod(s) here ]

...modification(s) in our current development version of Minerva R3.
If you mod(s) is based on, or extends someone elses code, then we
have already contacted that developer and received approval from them.

As stated above, Minerva is released under the GPL and CVS is
(anonymously) available to anyone who would like it. If you are
agreeable in allowing us use your code, then we will add details
of your contribution to our credits database, which will also be
bundled with R3 when we release it officially.

If you have any other terms of use then let me know, I am will try to
accommodate them :-) If you are interested then you can find a little
more detail about Minerva in the text below.

Thanks in advance, Martin.





More About Project Minerva
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far we have released a beta of Minerva R2, but since that initial
release the development team decided to go back to the drawing board.
Learning from the work we have done previously and acting of user
feedback we are going to correct the things we didn't get quite right
first time around.

We are currently working on the Minerva R3 core. Minerva R3 is still
based on phpBB 2.0.8a but this time we are attempting to addresses
several areas where we felt Minerva R2 failed.

1. Improved performance and scalability
2. Improved modularity
3. Improved ease of use
4. Less bloat

1. Database caching is used extensively and new features are selected
and added carefully so as not to over burden the DBMS or server load.
This work is not complete however but over the coming weeks it will be
improved significantly.

2. We have created a modules system and have integrated a customized
version of IM Portal as our blocks engine. This means that R3 is more
like a *Nuke portal in the way new modules and blocks can be uploaded,
installed and enabled without having to manually edit the core
files/template to extend a site. Every page and module can have its own
block selection and placement.

3 & 4. Less is more ;-) Minerva R2 initially set out to be a fairly slim
phpBB portal, but it soon became quite fat. Thanks in part to the block
and module engine this can be avoided in R3, but we are also aware which
features of R2 were little used, and these are being dropped in favour
of performance and ease of use.
